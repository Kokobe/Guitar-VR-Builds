# Guitar-VR-Builds

Since I want to release this app onto the Oculus Store, I'm not going to make the code public until it's published. For those who are interested in trying it out, download the apk here and install it into your Oculus Quest. 

Big thanks to FusedVR for helping me integrate hand-tracking! (https://github.com/FusedVR/Oculus-Quest-VRTK)

If you are a job recruiter who wants to see some of my code, email me at jkobechang@gmail.com and I will send you the project.
